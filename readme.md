# Voice Assistant

This project is a voice assistant built in 2021, one of my first projects. The voice assistant uses the SpeechRecognition library and Pyttsx3 to interact with users and perform various tasks.

## Project Overview

The voice assistant is designed to respond to voice commands and perform a range of skills, making it a versatile tool for users. It can open websites, launch applications, provide the latest weather information, solve math problems using Wolfram Alpha, maintain a to-do list, and serve as a dictionary.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Understands and processes voice commands using the SpeechRecognition library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides vocal responses using the Pyttsx3 library for a natural interaction experience.
- **Website and App Launcher**: Opens specified websites and applications based on user requests.
- **Weather Information**: Fetches the latest weather updates for any specified location.
- **Math Problem Solver**: Integrates with Wolfram Alpha to solve math problems and provide detailed solutions.
- **Movie Lists**: Provides information on movies based on user queries.
- **To-Do List Management**: Allows users to add, view, and remove tasks from a to-do list.
- **Dictionary Functionality**: Provides definitions and meanings of words upon request.
- **And many, many more features!**

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **SpeechRecognition**: A library for performing speech recognition, allowing the assistant to understand voice commands.
- **Pyttsx3**: A text-to-speech conversion library in Python for vocal responses.
- **Wolfram Alpha API**: Used to solve mathematical problems and retrieve information.
